# USA Real Estate — starter website

A responsive English real-estate lead-generation website with Supabase data storage and a protected admin dashboard.

## Files
- `index.html` — public homepage, property search, inquiry form
- `admin.html` — admin sign-in, lead list/status updates, add/activate properties
- `privacy.html` — starter privacy notice (must be customized)
- `styles.css`, `admin.css` — responsive styling
- `js/config.js` — Supabase URL and publishable key
- `js/app.js`, `js/admin.js` — frontend behavior
- `js/export.js`, `js/xlsx-lite.js` — "Download Excel" for leads (small built-in writer, no external library)
- `features.css` — styles for the selected-property box, photo upload and lead table
- `supabase-schema.sql` — database tables, grants, Row Level Security policies, and the v2 upgrade (optional email, property link on leads, property type, photo storage bucket)

## Features
- Visitors pick a property with "Request details"; the inquiry is saved with that property. Email is optional.
- Every property has a shareable link: `index.html?property=<id>` (use "Copy link" in Admin → Properties for Facebook posts etc.).
- Admin → Properties: upload a photo from your computer (resized to max 1600px and stored in the `property-images` bucket).
- Admin → Customer leads: shows each lead's property and "Download Excel" exports all leads in your sheet layout (Traffic Name, Number, Rent / Price, House, Address, Post List, Text Link, Id name, then Email, Interest, Status, Message, Date).

## Setup
1. In Supabase SQL Editor, run `supabase-schema.sql`.
2. `js/config.js` already contains this project's URL and **publishable** key. Never use a `service_role` or secret key in browser code.
3. In Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users, create the admin user using the authorized admin email. Set a strong unique password and enable MFA if available.
4. Open `supabase-make-admin.sql`, replace `YOUR_ADMIN_EMAIL` with that user's email, and run it in the SQL Editor (no UUID copying needed). It should return exactly 1 row.
5. Optional: run `supabase-sample-properties.sql` to add 3 test listings (replace with real listings before launch).
6. Deploy the folder to GitHub Pages or another static host. Ensure `index.html`, `admin.html`, `privacy.html`, CSS, and JS files keep the same relative paths.
6. Test an inquiry from a private/incognito browser. Then sign in at `/admin.html` and verify the lead is visible.

## Security notes
- Public visitors can insert inquiries but cannot read them.
- Admin authorization is checked against `admin_users`; the database RLS policies enforce access.
- Never expose Supabase secret/service-role keys in frontend files.
- Add CAPTCHA/anti-spam and server-side rate limiting before running paid traffic campaigns. Consider a Supabase Edge Function or trusted server endpoint for stronger abuse controls.
- Configure allowed redirect URLs and site URL in Supabase Auth.
- The privacy notice is a starter only. Have it reviewed and completed for your business and the states in which you operate.
- This is a lead-generation website starter, not a brokerage license, MLS feed, fair-housing compliance review, or legal advice.

## Important image note
Replace the sample image URLs with licensed property photography you have permission to use. Update the hero image URL in `styles.css` if you want a different hero photo.
